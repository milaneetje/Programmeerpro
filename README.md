## Real world Problem 
At my local gym, I saw that one thing that was missing to make it easier for users to sign up for groupfitnessclasses was an application they could use to sign up.

## Solution
A centralized app with a up to date interactive timetable where users can see all lessons, find more information like location, time and a description, and register for lessons.

## Prerequisites
### Data sources
For this app I will use data from https://github.com/stgm/rester/blob/master/README.md to store my classes and user information.

### External components
There are no external components

### Similar apps
One application that GUI wise is how I'd envision my application would preferably look and work is the official application of the intreeweek of the UvA. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.intreeweek.app. I was not able to acces the sourcecode of this app so I can't be sure how they implemented different aspects of their application. 

### Hardest parts
The Rester functionality and getting data from the various API's might turn out to be more of a problem than I had previously figured. Front end wise I see that the time table might be a problem mostly due to the fact that I'd like to be able to scroll vertically as well as horizontally through the activity.
